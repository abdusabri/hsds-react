# Core Values

HSDS is a resource for designers and engineers that follows these principles:

- The source of truth for UI components at Help Scout.
- One of the goals fo HSDS is to make it possible to componentize the front-end.
- It strives to be unambiguous, so there should not be multiple variations of the same component.
- We design and develop thinking for the short term, keeping things simple and iteratively adding features as we need them.
- Empowering contributors by minimizing the amount of blockers and hurdles.
- Contributors should be confident to push back on design or changes to an existent component within HSDS (there should be a valid reason for a new component/variant)
- The insights from engineering and design hold equal weight. Questions, input and advice are always welcome.
- Hold people accountable and make collaboration easier by providing points of contact for each component (who designed and who coded) and which part of the product is using it.

## Atomic design / Lego blocks

It is very common to use Lego Blocks as the analogy for a component system like HSDS, but we firmly believe this is not the best way to think about it.

We don’t think the perfect analogy exists, but keeping it in the same family of products, think more Duplo than Lego, with Lego you can build infinite variations of a firetruck using the little pieces. Instead, Duplo provides the firetruck not the wheels, the doors or the headlights. You get the same firetruck everywhere you need it, and don't risk having a firetruck with 5 wheels somewhere.

Having this mindset makes contributing to HSDS a little less complex.

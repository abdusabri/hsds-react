# VisuallyHidden

A VisuallyHidden component is tiny helper that hides content from view, without hiding from accessibility devices like screen readers.

Typically, you would add text inside of a VisuallyHidden component. However, you may add selectors and other React components as well.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default">
    <VisuallyHidden>Peek-a-boo! You can't see me</VisuallyHidden>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
